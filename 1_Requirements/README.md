# INTRODUCTION 
Health insurance access, quality and affordability are issues all around the globe. There are settled in varieties in light of pay and geography, and the high costs of restorative administrations present moderateness challenges for countless people. Significant amounts of individuals don't get the quality care that they require. Convenient advancement offers ways to deal with help with these challenges. Cardiovascular sickness has demonstrated that heart beat rate assumes a key part in the danger of heart assault. Coronary illness, for example, heart assault, coronary illness, congestive heart disappointment, and intrinsic coronary illness is the main source of death for men and ladies in numerous nations. More often than not, coronary illness issues hurt the elderly individual. Frequently, they live with their own and nobody is willing to screen them for 24 hours a day. In this proposed system, the pulse rates of patients are calculated or take care by utilizing sensors as simple method.
# EXISTING WORK 
universally, cardiovascular ailments are the main source of passings overall representing roughly 17.3 million passings every year. Monetary misfortunes because of cardiovascular dis-facilitates in low and center pay nations somewhere around 2011 and 2025 are assessed to be USD 3.76 trillion to which coronary illness contributes significantly. Moving far from existing scenario of treating patients for post cardiovascular entanglements to a framework able to do early recognition of anomalous or basic heart condition can turn out be an existence rescuer for some heart patients. Nonstop checking of heart including Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals as a major aspect of a remote observing framework connected with screening by specialists in claim to fame doctor's facilities improves the odds of early identification of any sort of cardiovascular abnormality.
# PROPOSED SYSTEM 
In this system we are continuously monitoring the patients different parameters such as body temperature, Heart Beat monitoring, respiration and transmitting this data to the doctors cabin continuously as well as displaying data at transmitter side so that patient also observed the relevant outputs and then at the receiver side or in doctors cabin the data is collected with Wi-Fi and microcontroller and displayed on relevant displays. The device can be used outdoors.
# HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS 
1) Power supply unit 
2) Microcontroller atmega328 
3) LCD display 16x2 
4) Temperature Sensor 
5) ECG sensor 
6) Respiration sensor 
7) Wi-Fi ESP8266 
# SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS 
1) platform - AVR STUDIO 
2) In system programmer - ProgISP 172 
3) compiler Win AVR 
# SWOT ANALYSIS 
# Strength 
- Reduce hospitalization in the short term and prevent or delay complications from disease, such as microvascular stroke or heart attack,in the long term 
# Weakness 
- Without the patient's willingness to be an active participant in their care, Real-time health monitoring devices implementation will likely fail 
# 4 W's and 1'H 
# WHAT 
Patient monitoring systems are collection of machines or equipment used to constantly monitor patients through various vital signs and warning systems to detect and record changes in patient wellbeing 
# WHERE 
Used in Hospitals 
# WHY 
Patient monitoring bridges the barrier of access by providing care to patients where they are, when they need it 
# WHEN 
High-capability, multifunction monitors are typically used in hospitals and clinics to ensure a high level of quality patient care 
# HOW 
The ADC sends the data to a microprocessor based signal processor which extracts features such as heart rate and blood pressure. After processing, the physiological signals are displayed on a display device and usually sent to a centralized ICU display system and frequently to a electronic patient record.
