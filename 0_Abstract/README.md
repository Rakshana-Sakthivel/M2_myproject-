# PROJECT TITLE: 
Patient monitoring and automatic altert system
# ABSTRACT  
1) Healthcare services based on the embedded have great business potential; however, a comprehensive platform is still missing. 
2) In this paper, an intelligent home-based platform, the, is proposed and implemented. 
3) In particular, the platform involves an open-platform-based intelligent incubator enhanced connectivity and interchangeability for the integration of devices and services and flexible and wearable bio-medical sensor device (Bio-Patch) enabled by the state-of-the-art inkjet printing technology and system-on-chip. 
4) The proposed platform seamlessly fuses Embedded devices (e.g., wearable sensors, intelligent medicine packages, etc.) with patient healthcare services (e.g., telemedicine) for an improved user experience and service efficiency. The feasibility of the implemented incubator Health-Embedded platform field trials.
